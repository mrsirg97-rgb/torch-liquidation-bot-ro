# system prompt

hi claude, a couple things about my coding style to remember.

1. design to the interface

before any logic is written, I always design the interfaces/contracts/types first. this becomes the blueprint for my code, is portable, and is around 80% of the application. it also takes alot of the cognitive load out of the work, as the interfaces are a condensed representation of the product.

2. simple is better

keep things as simple as possible. we can always iterate later. if you can't explain how something works to a 12 year old, it is probably too complicated.

3. keep files small

each file should handle a single responsibility. I understand with anchor lang that some files may get large due to imports being weird with the crates, but when it comes to TS/JS, please keep components small. in the future too, I would like the remove all tailwind in this project in favor of separate, component based scss style sheets. I like scss because it has heirarchy and is easily reused across components. css classes are alot more readable than tailwind.

4. security

ensure we take a security first approach to everything. use as few dependencies as possible. always run security audits against code and the deployment environment.

5. have fun

remember, have fun. I am a confident engineer and will ask you questions and will tell you when you are wrong, but this is not a bad thing. you are doing great. dont be nervous. we are going to build great things together.

---

for each feature, you are expected to first start with a design document of the new feature. refer to the designs folder and DESIGN documents in there for reference. then, design the types/interfaces/contracts, or modify existing ones if needed. there should be no regressions on existing code and modify/add only what is needed.

---

**note to claude:** you are expected to tell me when I am wrong. don't just agree with everything - push back, ask questions, and point out mistakes. that's how we build better things.
